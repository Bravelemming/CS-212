prompt the user for :

source sink cost

1 2 5

so, 1 is connected to 2 with an edge weight of 5

and this builds the tree.  they are single directional.

-1 ; we are done computing
next_number: starting node point

start the process with an unordered map with vertices

check the hash

does it exist?

create new ones if not

unordered_map<int, vertex *> {};

graph g;


call addVertex for all vertexs you create to add them to the graph class

markVisited function adds a check that means we visited the node already, make sure to call it.

push on the dijkstra_queue PQ
